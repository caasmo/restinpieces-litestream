# restinpieces-litestream

This repository provides a Litestream integration module for the [restinpieces](https://github.com/caasmo/restinpieces) framework. It allows you to easily add continuous backup capabilities for your application's SQLite database(s) using Litestream.

## Configuration

This module uses the standard `litestream.yml` configuration format. Litestream configuration is managed securely through the restinpieces `SecureConfigStore`, which is managed with the `ripc` command-line tool.

1.  **Create a `litestream.yml` file:** Create a standard Litestream configuration file. You can find examples and a full reference in the [official Litestream configuration documentation](https://litestream.io/reference/config/).

2.  **Encrypt and Store with `ripc`:** Use the `ripc config save` command to encrypt and store your YAML file in the application's database. The scope must be `litestream`, as defined by `litestream.ConfigScope`.

    ```bash
    ripc -age-key /path/to/your/age.key -dbpath /path/to/your/app.db config save -scope litestream /path/to/your/litestream.yml
    ```
    For more information on `ripc`, see the [`ripc` documentation](https://github.com/caasmo/restinpieces/blob/master/doc/ripc.md).

## Logging

The logging integration is designed as a pragmatic compromise to avoid maintaining a complex fork of the upstream Litestream library.

This module follows a **"split-logging"** model:

1.  **Framework Logs:** All logs generated by the `restinpieces-litestream` daemon wrapper itself are sent to the main framework's `slog.Logger` instance. If you are using the default `restinpieces` setup, these logs will be written to the SQLite database with full structured context.

2.  **Internal Litestream Logs:** All internal logs from the core Litestream components (e.g., relating to replication, snapshots, compaction) are sent to **`os.Stderr`**. This behavior mimics running Litestream as a separate binary alongside the main application.

### Configuring Internal Logs

While these internal logs are sent to a separate stream, you can still control their **format** and **level** via the `litestream.yml` configuration file. This is handled by a function from our Litestream fork that configures the library's internal global logger.

Example `litestream.yml` logging section:
```yaml
logging:
  # 'debug', 'info', 'warn', or 'error'
  level: 'debug' 
  # 'text' or 'json'
  type: 'json'
```
This configuration would cause the internal Litestream logs written to `os.Stderr` to be structured JSON at the `DEBUG` level, while the main framework logs continue to go to their own destination.

## Integration Example

Refer to [cmd/example/main.go](./cmd/example/main.go) to see how to:
*   Initialize the `restinpieces.Server`.
*   Load the Litestream YAML configuration from the secure store.
*   Instantiate the `litestream.Litestream` service.
*   Add it as a daemon to the `restinpieces.Server`.

## Driver Compatibility

As of v0.5.0, the underlying [Litestream library](https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream) uses the excellent [modernc.org/sqlite](https://modernc.org/sqlite) driver, which is **pure-Go**.

This is a major advantage as it means this module has **no CGO dependency**.
*   No C compiler or external dependencies are needed to build your application.
*   Cross-compilation is simple.
*   There are no conflicts with any other SQLite drivers (whether pure-Go or CGO-based) that your main application might use.

## SQLite PRAGMAs for Litestream

Consider setting the following PRAGMAs in your application when initializing the database connection for optimal performance and compatibility with Litestream:

https://litestream.io/tips/

Disable autocheckpoints for high write load servers.  Prevent aplication to do
checkpoints:

    PRAGMA wal_autocheckpoint = 0;

This mode will ensure that the fsync() calls are only called when the WAL
becomes full and has to checkpoint to the main database file. This is safe as
the WAL file is append only. Should be probably default when using WAL:

    PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;

Litestream requires periodic but short write locks on the database when
checkpointing occurs. SQLite will return an error by default if your
application tries to obtain a write lock at the same time.
This pragma will wait up to a given number of milliseconds before failing a
query if it is blocked on a write.

    PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000;
