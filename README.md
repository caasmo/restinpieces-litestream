Disable autocheckpoints for high write load servers.  Prevent aplication to do
checkpoints:

    PRAGMA wal_autocheckpoint = 0;

This mode will ensure that the fsync() calls are only called when the WAL
becomes full and has to checkpoint to the main database file. This is safe as
the WAL file is append only. Should be probably default when using WAL:

    PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;

Litestream requires periodic but short write locks on the database when
checkpointing occurs. SQLite will return an error by default if your
application tries to obtain a write lock at the same time.
This pragma will wait up to a given number of milliseconds before failing a
query if it is blocked on a write.

    PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000;
